		<h1>LDBS disc image format v0.4</h1>
		<h2>John Elliott, 9 July 2019</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>LDBS is a disc image format originally designed for internal use in LibDsk,
with the intended use case being for archiving FM / MFM floppy discs.  
This specification is provided for comment and suggestions, in case the 
format proves useful in other situations.</p>

<p>The suggested file extension is .ldbs.</p>

<p>The reference implementation for this version of LDBS is 
ldbs.c / ldbs.h, supplied with LibDsk v1.5.11.</p>

<p>The file structure is defined at two levels: a generic block store, and 
the specific block types used to specify a disc image.</p>

<p><b>Rationale:</b> Why a new disc image format? As mentioned above, it
was designed for use as an intermediate format in LibDsk. The aim is to 
have feature parity with CPCEMU extended .DSK, but in a more extensible 
format with greater support for in-place rewrites. It is not, for example,
possible to reformat a track from 8 to 9 512-byte sectors in an EDSK file,
without rewriting all subsequent tracks.</p>

<h2>Change history</h2>

<dl>
<dt>0.4 (9 July 2019)</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Added support for sectors whose size is not a power of 2.</li>
<li>Added support for Macintosh GCR encoding.</li>
<li>Added support for 'MBIN' and 'RSRC' blocks (MacBinary header and Apple resource fork).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>0.3 (8 March 2017)</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Altered the definition of the track and sector headers to support some 
CPC copy-protection methods and add further extensibility. Since this is a 
breaking change to the binary file format, I have increased the version number 
in the header.</li>
</ul>
<dt>0.2 (3 March 2017)</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Added a warning against storing file offsets in custom blocks.</li>
<li>Implemented a few more helper methods. The disc image format itself
remains unchanged.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>0.1 (16 March 2016)</dt>
<dd>Original version.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Data storage: Block Store</h2>

<p>All 16-bit and 32-bit values are stored in Intel format (low byte first).</p>
<p>File offsets and block lengths are 32 bit little-endian doublewords. To 
avoid signed / unsigned issues, they should not exceed 2^31.</p>

<h3>Header</h3>

<p>All LDBS files begin with a 20-byte header:</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th>Offset</th><th>Type</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0000</td><td>4 bytes</td><td>LDBS magic number:
			<tt>0x4C 0x42 0x53 0x01</tt> ('<tt>LBS\01</tt>')</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0004</td><td>4 bytes</td><td>File type. For a disc image
			this is <tt>0x44 0x53 0x4B 0x02</tt>
			('<tt>DSK\02</tt>'). If it is 
			<tt>0x44 0x53 0x4B 0x01</tt> ('<tt>DSK\01</tt>') then
			it is in <a href="ldbs-0.2.html">LDBS 0.2</a> or 
			earlier format. Such disc images are not likely to be 
			in wide circulation and I don't think you need to 
			bother implementing support for them. The supplied 
			<tt>ldbs_v2</tt> utility can convert disc images in 
			the earlier format to the current version.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0008</td><td>offset</td><td>Offset of first block in
			'used' linked list. Zero means there are no used
			data blocks.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x000C</td><td>offset</td><td>Offset of first block in
			'free' linked list. Zero means there are no free
			data blocks.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0010</td><td>offset</td><td>Offset of track directory.
			Zero means there is no track directory.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>If the offsets at 0x0008 / 0x000C / 0x0010 are non-zero, they must be 
file offsets of valid data blocks. It is an error for them to point to any 
other location in the file.</p>

<p>Within the block store layer the track directory is optional, 
but a valid LDBS disc image must have a track directory.</p>

<p>Although the block store layer is currently only defined as containing a 
disc image, it would be usable as a container for other file formats; 
this would be indicated by a different value at offset 0x0004. The use of
the block store for other file formats is not covered further by this 
document.</p>

<h3>Data blocks</h3>
<p>The header is followed by one or more data blocks (a file with no data
blocks is structurally valid, but would not contain a track directory). There
is no constraint on the order of blocks in a file; a track header does
not have to be stored together with its associated sectors, for example.</p>

<p>For an LDBS disc image, is recommended that a given data block should not 
exceed 64k in size.</p>

<p>There are no alignment requirements; blocks can begin at any file offset.</p>

<p>Each data block has its own 20-byte header:</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th>Offset</th><th>Type</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0000</td><td>4 bytes</td><td>Block signature:
			<tt>0x4C 0x44 0x42 0x01</tt> ('<tt>LDB\01</tt>')</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0004</td><td>4 bytes</td><td>Block type. 4-byte value 
			as defined below. <tt>0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00</tt>
			indicates a free block, other values indicate a 
			used block.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0008</td><td>length</td><td>Length of block on disc (not 
			including this 20-byte header)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x000C</td><td>length</td><td>Length of block contents,  
			less than or equal to length of block on disc.
			Should be set to zero for a free block.	
			</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0010</td><td>offset</td><td>Offset of next block in
			used / free linked list. Zero if this is the 
			last block in the list.</td></tr>			
</table>
<p>The header is followed immediately by the block data.</p>

<p>If a block is recorded in the track directory (see below) its block type 
is used to identify it, and so must be unique within the file. The block
type is not required to be unique for blocks not recorded in the directory.
</p> 

<p>If the offset at 0x0010 is non-zero, it must point to another valid 
data block.</p>

<p>If the length of the block on disc is greater than the length of the 
block contents, an implementation is encouraged to fill the remainder with 
zero bytes, but is not obliged to. Similarly a free block should be filled 
with zeroes, but is not required to be.</p>

<p>Data blocks can be enumerated either by stepping through the file in 
linear order, or by following the used / free linked lists.</p>

<p>It is an error for there to be a 'free' block on the 'used' linked list,
or a 'used' block on the 'free' linked list.</p>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>Typical operations performed at block level are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get the length of a block. Given an offset, load the block
	header at that offset and return its length.</li>
	<li>Load a block. Given an offset, load the block header and data
	at that offset.</li>
	<li>Add a block. Search the free list for an entry greater than or
	equal to the required size. If one is found, remove the entry from
	the free list, add it to the used list, and populate with the data.
	If not found, append a new block of the required size to the end of 
	the file, and add it to the used list.</li>
	<li>Delete a block. Remove the block from the used list, add it to
	the free list, and zero its block type.</li>
	<li>Update a block. If the new size is less than or equal to the 
	block's current size on disc, write the data into the block at its
	current location. Otherwise, treat as delete followed by add.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there is no requirement to coalesce adjacent free blocks, or to
split a block if the size requested is less than its current size on disc.</p>

<h2>Data storage: Disc image</h2>

<h3>Track directory</h3>
<p>A disc image must contain a track directory block. The intention is 
that an implementation will use the track directory to locate data rather 
than performing linear searches of the file or walking its linked lists.</p>

<p>The format of the track directory is:</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th>Offset</th><th>Type</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>

	<tr><td>0x0000</td><td>20 bytes</td><td>LDBS block header. Type 
			field contains <tt>0x44 0x49 0x52 0x01</tt> 
			('<tt>DIR\01</tt>')</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0014</td><td>16-bit word</td><td>Number of directory entries</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0016</td><td>8 bytes per entry</td><td>Directory entries</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The format of a directory entry is one of <tt>T<var>xxx</var></tt>,
<tt>INFO</tt>, <tt>CREA</tt>, <tt>DPB</tt>, <tt>GEOM</tt>, <tt>MBIN</tt>,
<tt>RSRC</tt>, or a custom block type (beginning with a lowercase 'a'-'z'). 
In each case, this is the block type of the corresponding block in the 
store.</p>

these in the disc image file. It will only be present on discs containing
a CP/M filesystem.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th>Offset</th><th>Type</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0000</td><td>4 bytes</td><td>'MBIN'</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0004</td><td>offset</td><td>Offset of MacBinary header block</td>

	<tr><td>0x0004</td><td>offset</td><td>Offset of Macintosh resource 
block</td>
</tr></table>
<p>Reference to a Macintosh resource fork. There is at most one of these in 
the disc image file.</p>

<h3>Custom block types</h3>

<p>Other block types than the ones listed here may be defined in later 
versions of this spec; implementations should ignore unknown block types. 
It may, for example, be useful at some point to create a 'BOOT' block type 
containing the keystrokes necessary to boot a disc, or a 'PICT' block 
containing a picture of the disc.</p>

<p>All future block types defined by this spec will start with a capital 
letter, 'A'-'Z'. Block types beginning with a lowercase letter 'a'-'z' 
can be used for private purposes &mdash; there is, of course, no guarantee 
that someone else won't pick the same block type for their own use.</p>

<p>You should avoid storing file offsets in your custom blocks. There is 
nothing stopping an LDBS implementation from rearranging blocks in a file
so they end up at different offsets (for example, to remove unused space).
However, such an implementation won't be aware of offsets held in custom 
blocks, and so won't update them. This isn't just a theoretical danger:
<tt>ldbs_clone()</tt> reverses the order of blocks when duplicating an
LDBS file.</p>

<p>The LibDsk TeleDisk, CopyQM and QRST drivers use custom blocks to hold
details from the original file headers which aren't used by other disc
image formats. These are, respectively, 'utd0', 'ucqm', and 'uqrs'.

<p>Since the track directory does not record the locations of individual
sectors, the block type field is not required to be unique. If an LDBS file
contained more than 256 cylinders, for example, sectors on cylinder 256 would
have the same block type as those on cylinder 0. Similarly if a track 
contained several copies of the same sector, all these copies would have 
the same block type.</p>

<p><b>Rationale:</b> CP/M filesystems are not self-describing. If the 
disc image was generated by an emulator or utility that is aware of the 
CP/M filesystem, it may be helpful to record the filesystem parameters used.
This is also necessary for round-trip compatibility with the YAZE YDSK 
format.</p>

<h3>Geometry block</h3>

<p>The geometry block is optional. It contains the drive geometry used by 
LibDsk when it last formatted a track in the disc image. On a 'straightforward'
disc image where all tracks have the same format, this will give the geometry 
of the entire file. On discs with varying numbers of sectors per track (such
as Macintosh GCR) it will inevitably fall short.

</table>
<p>Note that the representation of the data rate and MFM recording mode 
isn't the same as in a track header. This is for binary compatibility with
LibDsk. FM and GCR recording modes have the same values in both 
structures.</p>

<p><b>Rationale:</b> If the imaged disc contains no superblock or other means 
to specify its own format, this can be used to suggest a geometry for 
accessing it.
</p>

<h3>Macintosh data</h3>

<p>To preserve data from files created under classic MacOS (for example by 
DiskCopy 4.2), two blocks are defined to hold the Finder information and 
resource fork of a file:</p>

<h4>MBIN block</h4>
<table border="1"><tr><th>Offset</th><th>Type</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0000</td><td>20 bytes</td><td>LDBS block header. Type 
			field contains <tt>0x4D 0x42 0x49 0x4E</tt> ('MBIN')
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0014</td><td>128 bytes</td>
		<td>Finder information, in the form of a MacBinary file 
		header. Some fields (such as the length of the data fork)
		will be irrelevant; the type and creator code may be more
		to the purpose.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>RSRC block</h4>
<table border="1"><tr><th>Offset</th><th>Type</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0000</td><td>20 bytes</td><td>LDBS block header. Type 
			field contains <tt>0x52 0x53 0x52 0x43</tt> ('RSRC')
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0x0014</td><td>Arbitrary length</td>
		<td>Macintosh resource fork</td></tr>
</table>

<p>When converting from an LDBS disc image to a Macintosh file, caution is
advised when using the MBIN / RSRC blocks. It's entirely possible that since
the file was originally created, it's been changed sufficiently that the 
blocks are out of sync. For example, Disk Copy 4.2 stores copies of the 
disc checksums in the resource fork of disc images it creates; if the 
contents of the disc image have changed, the checksums will need to be 
recalculated when the new resource fork is written out.</p>

<h2>Compression</h2>

<p>The only form of compression is omitting sectors that are blank or 
unreadable (by setting the 'copies' field in the sector header to 0). Should 
it prove necessary to compress LDBS disc images further, this should 
be done using an external utility such as gzip (LibDsk can transparently 
decompress gzipped disc images).</p>

<h2>Reference Implementation</h2>

<p>ldbs.h / ldbs.c in LibDsk 1.5.11 contain an X11-licensed reference 
implementation of LDBS. A few sample utilities are also supplied: </p>
<ul>
	<li>dsk2ldbs: Converts DSK / EDSK disc images to LDBS.</li>
	<li>ldbs2dsk: Converts LDBS disc images to DSK / EDSK.</li>
	<li>ldbs2raw: Converts LDBS disc images to a raw data dump.</li>
	<li>ldbstest: Sanity test of block layer functions.</li>
	<li>ldbsdump: Displays the contents of an LDBS file.</li>
	<li>ldbscopy: Copies one LDBS file to another using the ldbs_clone()
		     function. As currently written this happens to reverse 
		     the order of blocks in the file, so all block offsets 
                     will change.</li>
	<li>ldbs_v2: Upgrades a file in LDBS v0.1 or v0.2 format to the 
		     current specification.</li>
</ul>
