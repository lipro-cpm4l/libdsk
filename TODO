TO BE DONE in LibDSK 1.1.x:

* dskid doesn't work on a DFS .DSK file. Why? Because get_id doesn't fail?
* Support for DMK file format.
* Java support for the Reporter classes is buggy [seems to work now 11-5-2003]
* Plugin architecture:
	dsk_register_driver
	dsk_register_compression
	dsk_register_remote
* Support for TD0 file format.

* Support remoting libdsk...
	>> May need to write a PCW backend that dances on the controller
	  rather than using decorum and the XBIOS.
	>> May need to write a Win16 version of serslave.
	>> May need to write a Win16 RPC client.

* Support a reverse-cpmfs backend (that lets a directory appear as a disc 
 image).
	>> File in directory called .libdsk.ini that gives LibDsk geometry
	  and CP/M directory info
	>> File in directory called .libdsk.boot containing boot sector.

	>> Full of debug code
	>> Default format is pcw720, not pcw180
	>> Needs to be compilable on other OSes

* The load-all-into-memory strategy in Apridisk won't work on DOS16. Does
 this matter, bearing in mind that the real Apridisk exists on DOS16?

* CopyQM: Compare to real BBC Master 512 disks 2-4.
