  Installing: On a Linux or Unix system, you should just be able to use the
standard

  ./configure 
  make 
  make install 

sequence. Something similar should work on Cygwin or Mingw32 systems.

  This will install libdsk and its three tools (dsktrans, dskform, dskid). To
install manual pages, you will also need to do a "make install-man".

  Options for "./configure": 

You can use "--disable-floppy" to leave out the code that attempts to access 
the host computer's native floppy drivers. 

You can use "--without-zlib" or "--without-bzlib" to remove support for 
on-the-fly .gz and .bz2 decompression.

You can use "--with-jni" to include Java Native Interface bindings. In this
case, after you've built LibDsk, you have to add /usr/local/lib/libdsk.jar 
to your CLASSPATH.

  The library will also compile with Borland C++ 5.0, which probably means
that it will compile with the free version 5.5 as well. It should also compile
with Visual C++ 1 or Visual C++ 6. Since these systems don't support autoconf, 
you'll need to use the provided workspaces and ready-made config.h files.
