/* Here are some things I hope to do with libdsk one day:

1. Test the Windows floppy driver. In particular, test the NT half.
2. Get linux_status() to work properly (currently it is disabled).
3. MSDOS floppy driver.
4. Port my CP/M disc utilities to libdsk.
5. Amstrad CP/M floppy driver. This requires finding a Unix -> Z80 cross
 C compiler that can compile libdsk; Hi-Tech C 3.09 isn't up to the job.
