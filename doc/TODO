/* Here are some things I hope to do with libdsk one day:

1. When building the Windows EXEs, use the DOS EXEs as stubs. 
2. Get linux_status() to work properly (currently it is disabled).
3. MSDOS floppy driver that accesses the hardware directly, rather than
  through the BIOS. 
4. If (4) is possible, do the same thing for Win16.
5. Port my CP/M disc utilities to libdsk.
6. Amstrad CP/M floppy driver. This requires finding a Unix -> Z80 cross
 C compiler that can compile libdsk; Hi-Tech C 3.09 isn't up to the job.
7. Support for dynamically-loadable drivers or compression systems.
