/* Here are some things I hope to do with libdsk one day:

1. When building the Windows EXEs, use the DOS EXEs as stubs. 
2. Get linux_status() to work properly (currently it is disabled).
3. Write RPC-over-mailslot code allowing Win32 programs to use the more 
  capable Win16 drivers. I have some prototype code for this, but this 
  margin is too narrow to contain it.
4. MSDOS floppy driver that accesses the hardware directly, rather than
  through the BIOS. 
5. If (4) is possible, do the same thing for Win16.
6. Write (or find someone who can write) Windows kernel-level drivers 
  so that LibDsk under Windows supports all the features of LibDsk under 
  Linux, such as deleted data, different sector sizes, FM recording...
7. Port my CP/M disc utilities to libdsk.
8. Amstrad CP/M floppy driver. This requires finding a Unix -> Z80 cross
 C compiler that can compile libdsk; Hi-Tech C 3.09 isn't up to the job.
9. Support for loading additional geometries from an XML or other file.
10. Support for dynamically-loadable drivers or compression systems.
