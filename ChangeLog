	* libdsk-1.1.6 released.
	* Bug fix: Don't leak file handles in drvcpcem.c.

2005-07-21 John Elliott

	* Fixed the '-logical' option in dsktrans so it doesn't fall over
	 with "bad parameter" errors.
	* libdskrc parser now understands 'sides' and 'sidedness' for
	 the how-to-treat-sidedness parameter. 

2005-07-03 John Elliott

	* libdsk-1.1.5 released.

2005-06-28 Daniel Black

	* Corrected an install bug in Makefile.am

2005-06-14 John Elliott

	* Added guard code against a buffer overrun in the DSK driver 
	 (if an attempt is made to format a track with more than 29 sectors)

	* Serial remote drivers and standalone serslave written for Linux, 
	 Win32, DOS16, DOS32 (DOS32 untested).

2005-06-14 John Elliott

	* Corrected a bug in the Linux and NTWDM drivers - dsk_xread was 
	 failing when the sector size passed in did not match the sector
	 size in the geometry structure.

	* Added dskdump and dskscan to the list of utilities that get 
	 installed. 

	* dskid(1) allows multiple arguments.

2005-05-10 John Elliott

	* Started expanding the internal 'RPC' system to support operation
	 over serial lines.

2005-03-14 John Elliott

	* libdsk-1.1.4 released.

	* Added dsk_{p,l}trkids() and dsk_rtread() functions.

	* Added COM bindings (Windows version).

2005-02-28 Simon Owen

2005-01-26 John Elliott

	* libdsk-1.1.3 released.

2005-01-25 John Elliott

	* Merged CopyQM format documentation from Per Ola Ingvarsson.

2005-01-21 John Elliott

	* dsk_getgeom refactored so that drivers can call the default 
	 guesser and then override individual fields. 
	* dsk_getgeom also supports detection of BBC Master 512 DOS Plus 
	 format, which is like acorn800 but has 1-based sector numbers.

	* CPCEMU read and write now use the passed sector size, not the
	 size in the geometry structure. 

	* Merged a read-only CopyQM driver from Per Ola Ingvarsson.

2005-01-18 John Elliott

	* Updated ApriDisk driver and apridisk.html with the official 
	 ApriDisk format definitions.

	* Continued knocking rcpmfs into shape.

	* Added -apricot, -noformat, -first and -last options to dsktrans.
	 Fixed the -retry option in dsktrans so the default is 1 and not 
	 MAXINT.

2005-01-16 John Elliott

	* Updated dg_aprigeom() to use sector size in the Apricot 
	 superblock.

2005-01-03 John Elliott

	* LibDsk now loads format definitions from a libdskrc file, allowing
	 user-defined formats.

	* Created an experimental rcpmfs driver which presents a filesystem
	 directory as a CP/M disk image.

2004-03-27 John Elliott

	* v1.1.2 release.

2003-01-11 John Elliott

	* Added support for density and recording mode to the DSK and
	 extended DSK file formats. See appendix C of the documentation
	 for the details of this.

2003-08-13 John Elliott

	* v1.1.1 release.

2003-08-13 John Elliott

	* Added dsk_set_retry() and dsk_get_retry() so that LibDsk can 
	 automatically retry reads/writes.

	* Added double-stepping support to the Linux floppy driver, thus
	 allowing 360k floppies to be imaged in 1.2Mb drives.

2003-02-13 John Elliott

	* Added a driver for the 'apridisk' disc image format. 

	* Added support for comments in disc images.

	* Added functions for LibDsk to display messages during lengthy
	 operations.

2003-01-13 John Elliott

	* v1.1.0 release.
	
	* Added a mini-RPC system to allow 32-bit Windows applications to use
	 the more capable 16-bit floppy API.
	* The 16-bit DLL is now called LIBDSK16.DLL, so it can be installed in
	 the same directory as the 32-bit DLL.

	* Added a driver for the 'nanowasp' disc image format.

	* Removed constraints on the parameter order of the example utilities. 

2002-12-16 John Elliott

	* v1.0.0 release. 

	* Minor portability fixes.

	* DOS16 and Win16 drivers retry three times; this avoids "Disc changed"
	 errors on drives that are slow to spin up.

2002-12-01 John Elliott

	* v0.9.9 release.

	* Projects provided to build LibDsk under 16-bit Windows and DOS;
	 bug fixes in the .DSK driver to work correctly on a 16-bit compiler
	 (CFI won't work on 16-bit DOS, except for very small images).
	* Drivers added for the Win16, DOS16 and DOS32 architectures. There 
	 may be a case for combining the source files for Win16 and DOS16 as 
	 they are quite similar.

	* Previous MYZ80 bugfix was faulty. Corrected.

2002-11-18 John Elliott

	* v0.9.5 release.

	* MicroDesign serial numbers can be read or altered by md3serial

	* Bug fix in the posix driver; when sectors are written beyond the
	 end of the file, the gap is filled with 0xE5 rather than leaving the
	 OS to decide what goes there.
	* Similar bug fix in the myz80 driver.

2002-04-27 John Elliott

	* v0.9.1 release.

	* Squeeze compression rewritten from scratch to avoid a possible
	 licence conflict.

2002-04-10 John Elliott

	* v0.9.0 release.

	* IMPORTANT CHANGES: This release breaks backward compatibility in a 
	 number of ways. Most importantly, you must replace "DSK_DRIVER *" 
	 with "DSK_PDRIVER " throughout your programs.

	* Support for reading/writing deleted data (DSK and Linux floppy 
	 only; other formats do not support marking data as deleted). 

	* DSK files in the extended CPCEMU format now have their own file 
	 type - "edsk". This means that extended DSK files can be created
	 using LibDsk.
	* Bug fixes in the extended DSK format handler (Thierry Jouin).

	* Transparent compression layer added, supporting Squeeze, GZip 
	 and BZip2 (read only).
	* Special-case DQK driver removed; the standard CPCEMU driver + 
	 the compression layer can now handle this case.

	* BBC Micro DFS formats added to the list of built-in formats, and
	 to the geometry probe. 
	* Bugfix in the Linux floppy driver so that discs with FM encoding
	 can be read (requires a suitable floppy controller and drive).

2002-04-06 John Elliott

	* v0.8.2 release.

	* New driver added: .DQK (.DSK compressed using Squeeze compression).

	* XCF2 200k format added to the list of built-in formats.

	* Darren Salt's manual pages added to the distribution.

2002-02-25 John Elliott

	* v0.8.0 release.

	* Support added for Java Native Interface bindings (requires JDK 
	 v1.1 or later). Use ./configure --with-jni to build them.
	* Java versions of dskid, dskform and dsktrans added.

2002-02-07 John Elliott

	* v0.7.0 release.

	* Support added for .CFI format (a strange format used by Cliff 
	 Lawson to distribute Amstrad PC boot floppies). 
	
	* Bug fixes in the example utilities (Darren Salt).

	* dsktrans includes a -format option to use a built-in geometry 
	 rather than trying to probe it from the disc.

	* PCW 800k format added to list of builtin formats.

2002-01-15 John Elliott

	* v0.6.0 release.

	* Acorn ADFS formats added to the list of formats, and to the 
	 geometry probe. These don't work on Windows because of the limitations
	 of the underlying floppy driver.

	* dsk_xread() and dsk_xwrite() altered so that only part of a sector
	 can be read or written.

	* Make libdsk compile in Microsoft Visual C++ (Kevin Thacker)

	* dskform supports all built-in disc geometries.
	* dg_stdformat() can be used to enumerate the built-in geometries.

	* dsktrans includes a "-logical" option to rearrange the tracks of
	 a disc, so that they come out in logical order in a "raw" file. This
	 option is only effective for ADFS and 144FEAT formats.
